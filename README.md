## Introduction

A new image restoration approach is proposed for the video sequence distorted by an undulating water surface. We use an iterative robust registration algorithm to remove most of distortions in the frames. Instead of registering each frame against the severely blurry mean, a patches fusion process is first employed to discard the patches with severer distortions and reconstruct the high quality image; and then the fused image is deblurred with the blind deconvolution process. After the registration process, the residuary unstructured noises are eliminated by the robust principal component analysis, which is called post-processing.

## Comments
  
1.The data sets can be obtained from [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/projects/IM/water/research_water.html).

2.Our code does not contain the part of post-processing,which can be found from [here](http://perception.csl.illinois.edu/matrix-rank/sample_code.html).
