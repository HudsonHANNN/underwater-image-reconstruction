## Introduction

A new image restoration approach is proposed for the video sequence distorted by an undulating water surface. We use an iterative robust registration algorithm to remove most of distortions in the frames. Instead of registering each frame against the severely blurry mean, a patches fusion process is first employed to discard the patches with severer distortions and reconstruct the high quality image; and then the fused image is deblurred with the blind deconvolution process. After the registration process, the residuary unstructured noises are eliminated by the robust principal component analysis, which is called post-processing.

## Runing Detail
1. Prepare the development environment of MATLAB
2. Download the document containing code and datasets.
3. Unzip the document that you downloaded just now.
4. Then unzip two package documents in root directory ,which are named datasets and Registration,respectively.
5. Add all documents in root directory into current directory of MATLAB.
6. There are three kinds of images in the directory named datasets,then load any one of them into workspace of MATLAB.
7. Run script named main,then wait a few minutes.
8. All Results are located in the root directory.


## Comments

1.Before running  main.m, the patch size of each data set should be manually set.The recommended patch size can be found in the paper.
   
2.The data sets can be obtained from [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/projects/IM/water/research_water.html).

3.Our code does not contain the part of post-processing,which can be found from [here](http://perception.csl.illinois.edu/matrix-rank/sample_code.html).
